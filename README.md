## **Disclaimer:**

**You can potentially brick your device. I don't take responsibility for any damage caused.**

## Requirements

1. A Windows computer with an Ethernet adapter and a Wireless adapter.

2. An Ethernet cable.

3. Python 3.10 with `pycryptodome` 3.17 installed.

4. `server_emulator.py` from this repository.

## Enabling SSH Service

1. Configure the router.

   - Set port 1 as the WAN port.

2. Connect your computer to a available wireless network and enable **Internet Connection Sharing** on the wireless network adapter's **Properties**. From the **Home networking connection** drop-down menu, select  **Your Ethernet Adapter**. This will set up a DHCP server on the Ethernet adapter and configure your computer as the gateway.

3. Connect the Ethernet port of your computer to **port 1** on the router. Now, the router should be able to obtain the following information and connect to the Internet.

4. Run server_emulator.py and wait for the router to found the connection.

   ```shell
   python.exe server_emulator.py
   ```

5. After waiting for about a minute, when the terminal outputs the router's information, it indicates a successful connection. Press any key to continue.

   ```shell
   # These commands will be executed
   echo -e 'admin\nadmin' | passwd root
   nvram set ssh_en=1 && nvram commit
   sed -i 's/channel=.*/channel="debug"/g' /etc/init.d/dropbear && /etc/init.d/dropbear start
   ```

6. Close the Python program when it finishes.

7. Connect the Ethernet port of your computer to LAN port on the router.  Log in to the router using your favorite ssh client and account/password: `root/admin`.
